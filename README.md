🚀 Hi there, I'm Cory Hawkkvelt! 👋


🌐 As the CTO of NextGen Cloud, I'm steering the ship through the exciting waters of system engineering. My playground includes networking 🌉, data centers 🏢, storage solutions 🗄️, virtualization 🖥️ and of course GPU's

🔓 I'm a passionate advocate for open source - it's like the secret sauce in tech's Big Mac! 🍔

🔧 When I'm not tinkering with systems, you'll find me contributing to the future of tech 💪

🤝 Looking forward to collaborating, learning, and innovating with you! 🌟
